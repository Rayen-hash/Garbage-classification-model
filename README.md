Description:
A machine learning project that classifies images of different types of waste (plastic, paper, organic, metal, etc.). The project uses Python and popular ML libraries to train and evaluate models for accurate classification.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy, Pandas

Git/GitHub

Features:

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Training and evaluation of CNN models

Predict waste type from new images

Mini-project suitable for academic and practical purposes

Status:
Project in progress. Some features and models are still being optimized.
